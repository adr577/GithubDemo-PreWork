## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

<h2>Youtube</h2>
<li>Ability to download videos offline</li>

<h2>MyFitnessPal</h2>

<li>Tells me how many grams I should eat of each macronutrient a day</li>
<li>Able to add custom exercises</li>

<h2>Strong</h2>

<p>An app I've always wanted to create would be a personal academic tracking app. It would have feautures like adding your desired academic work subjects you 
want to improve on(ex: C++), and inside the folder you can track how many hours a week you've spent practicing, your fallbacks, and and a mini portfolio of what courses, projects, assignments that you have done. There would be other features such as challenging a friend for your desired time period and you'll be able to compare data with each other. Also there would be a progrss bar so people can fill good about themselves as the more work and hours logged the more the bar 
goes up and you can level up and earn rewards.</p>
